# Chrome Extension Email Tracker

This repo contains code for a Chrome Extension to track emails
sent by the Gmail Web Client. It was made using a Node.JS boiler plate for
the [gmail.js](https://github.com/KartikTalwar/gmail.js/) library. The
boiler plate can be found [here](https://github.com/josteink/gmailjs-node-boilerplate).
